[premise 13] then all isit are newden, so x is newden.\n7. [premise 12] all newden are plylow, so x is plylow.\n8. [premise 7] all plylow are veltain, so x is veltain.\n9.

(in our version we follow a slightly extended chain: from mancon (by 16) we get tugan, then by (11) paun, by (9) longhar, by (10) finness.)\n\n4. meanwhile, \u201call fameas are manvis\u201d (2) and \u201call manvis are pointple\u201d (5) imply that any fameas is pointple.\n\n5. but we also have \u201cno pointple are torstry\u201d (15). and note that every object in the finness\u2013chain (from mancon upward) is forced into the torstry region (since, for example, all mancon are torstry by (4)).\n\n6. thus if our witness (which is in the measic chain, and therefore by the chain is forced into torstry) were fameas it would be both pointple and torstry\u2014a contradiction with (15). therefore the witness cannot be fameas.\n\n7. hence we have an element that is estnal (by 22) and not fameas; i.e. \u201csome estnal are not fameas.\u201d\n\na careful check shows the unique minimal premises used in the proof are those that (i) provide an existent \u201cwitness\u201d in measic via \u201call nelwork are measic\u201d (27), (ii) lift from measic to estnal (22), (iii) force the witness into the non\u2010fameas finness\u2013chain (by (26), (17), (14), (29), and (4)), and (iv) show fameas lies apart from that chain (via (2), (5), and (15)).\n\nthus the unique minimal set of premises is as given above.",

(premise 19 tells us that every citis is an outout; premise 1 then gives that outout are writried; and premise 21 implies writried are sisven.) hence, every citis is sisven.\n\n\u2022 on the other hand, from premise 26 we have that every citis is manlow, and by premise 33 every manlow is lessdi.\n\n\u2022 now suppose for contradiction that a citis were vifac. then, via the following chain:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 premise 27: vifac \u2192 bipa,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 premise 25: bipa \u2192 fixther,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 premise 4: fixther \u2192 agact,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 premise 12: agact \u2192 yther,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 premise 15: yther \u2192 ermal,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 premise 30: ermal \u2192 enceered,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 premise 8: enceered \u2192 dangi,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 premise 29: dangi \u2192 landci,\nwe deduce that any vifac is landci.\n\n\u2022 but premise 3 says no landci is lessdi. therefore a citis that is vifac (and so, landci) would contradict that it is lessdi \u2013 while by the earlier chain (via premises 26 and 33) every citis must be lessdi.\n\nthus some sisven (namely, the citis) cannot be vifac. these 14 premises form the unique minimal set in the given knowledge base that proves \u201csome sisven are not vifac.\u201d",

(in problems of this kind the non\u2010emptiness is assumed.) then:\n\n\u2022 by premise 1, every alto is terply; by 28, every terply is coment; by 8, every coment is derssat; by 32, every derssat is nearsand; by 6, every nearsand is cucar; and by 29, every cucar is sufix. hence every alto is sufix.\n\n\u2022 by premise 30, every alto is troing; by 23, every troing is catties; and by 18, every catties is ganheav. hence every alto is ganheav.\n\nthus any alto is an example of something that is ganheav and (because it is sufix) not citples\u2014but to \u201cseparate\u201d them from citples we need to know that no sufix can be citples. for that, we \u201ccollapse\u201d the chain running from citples upward:\n\u2003\u2003premise 3 tells us all citples are cypi;\n\u2003\u200313 tells us all cypi are ferex;\n\u2003\u20037 tells us all ferex are berpa;\n\u2003\u20032 tells us all berpa are sital;\n\u2003\u200310 tells us all sital are readful;\n\u2003\u200317 tells us all readful are velca; and\n\u2003\u20034 tells us all velca are gerci.\nthus every citple is in fact gerci. but premise 31 says no sufix is gerci. therefore no alto (being sufix) can be citple.\n\nsince we have shown that any (in particular, some) alto is ganheav and not citple, the hypothesis \u201csome ganheav are not citples\u201d is proved.\n\nthe minimal set of premises used\u2014covering the \u201calto-to\u2013ganheav\u201d chain (30, 23, 18), the \u201calto-to\u2013sufix\u201d chain (1, 28, 8, 32, 6, 29), and the \u201ccitples-to\u2013gerci\u201d chain (3, 13, 7, 2, 10, 17, 4) together with the critical disjointness (31)\u2014is exactly those listed above.",

(although \u201call asis are \u2026\u201d is given rather than an existential statement, in our syllogistic framework the non\u2010emptiness of at least one term is assumed. in any case, one may use the other existential premises in the knowledge base to guarantee non\u2010emptiness of the domain.)\n\n\u2022 by premise17 \u201call asis are mainset\u201d and then by premise1 \u201call mainset are menthunt,\u201d premise11 \u201call menthunt are gleact,\u201d premise26 \u201call gleact are afhap,\u201d premise15 \u201call afhap are nearnal,\u201d premise8 \u201call nearnal are carso,\u201d premise25 \u201call carso are gili,\u201d and finally premise6 \u201call gili are maglent,\u201d we deduce that every asis is maglent.\n\n\u2022 also, by premise23 \u201call asis are plyny.\u201d but premise20 \u201cno plyny are ralion\u201d ensures that any asis x (which is plyny) is not ralion.\n\n\u2022 separately, the chain given by premise18 \u201call pressnu are lightber,\u201d premise2 \u201call lightber are terten,\u201d premise5 \u201call terten are tieswil,\u201d premise10 \u201call tieswil are adply,\u201d premise13 \u201call adply are oustive,\u201d and premise4 \u201call oustive are ralion\u201d shows that every pressnu is ralion.\n\n\u2022 finally, premises21 \u201call landra are saun\u201d and 22 \u201call saun are pressnu\u201d imply that if x were landra then x would be pressnu. but we already saw x is not ralion\u2014and every pressnu is ralion. thus x cannot be pressnu and so x \u2013 by contrapositive \u2013 cannot be landra.\n\nthus the chosen asis\u2010witness is maglent (by the first chain) and not landra (by the second chain). these 18 premises (listed above) are exactly the minimal set needed to prove the query hypothesis \u201csome maglent are not landra.\u201d",

(this chain is obtained by using \u201call estbet are landsny\u201d (20), then \u201call landsny are lowted\u201d (26), \u201call lowted are airca\u201d (11), \u201call airca are cition\u201d (7), \u201call cition are wayes\u201d (17), \u201call wayes are enket\u201d (19), \u201call enket are tusur\u201d (8), \u201call tusur are conno\u201d (25), \u201call conno are auat\u201d (14), and finally \u201cno auat are lentes\u201d (3).) thus every estbet is not lentes.\n\non the other hand, by the other chain we show that every letder object \u201clives in\u201d lentes \u2013 namely using \u201call letder are nerau\u201d (15), \u201call nerau are centmen\u201d (24), \u201call centmen are telvar\u201d (23), \u201call telvar are tingre\u201d (21), \u201call tingre are befor\u201d (27), \u201call befor are supmoth\u201d (2), \u201call supmoth are tednu\u201d (16), \u201call tednu are merau\u201d (5), \u201call merau are evegan\u201d (4) and \u201call evegan are lentes\u201d (28). so every letder is a lentes.\n\nsince no object can be both \u201clentes\u201d and \u201cnot lentes,\u201d no estbet object may be letder. finally, using the existential \u201csome rose are estbet\u201d (18) we know some estbet exists; hence, indeed, some estbet are not letder.\n\nbecause every premise in these two disjoint chains is needed, the unique minimal set of premises to derive the hypothesis is the 21 premises listed above.",

(that is, sidetor \u2286 manen \u2286 algan \u2286 newval.) also, by (14) and (21) every seway is magcal. thus if we can exhibit some seway that is not newval then that element (by \u201cseway \u2286 magcal\u201d) is magcal and cannot be a siderator (since all siderator are newval).\n\npremise (27) tells us that \u201csome seway are tocen.\u201d then one verifies that every tocen is, via the chain (5) \u2192 (8) \u2192 (22) \u2192 (7) \u2192 (12) \u2192 (4) \u2192 (19) \u2192 (16) \u2192 (6) \u2192 (13), in the eastered group. on the other hand, by (23), (20) and (11) an element in newval belongs to ganheav, then to baals, then to mentsfi; and (25) tells us that no mentsfi are eastered. hence if an element x is tocen then x is eastered and cannot satisfy \u201cx is newval\u201d (since newval \u2286 mentsfi which is disjoint from the eastered group). therefore the seway element guaranteed by (27) is not newval. since every siderator is newval, that element is not a siderator.\nfinally, since (14) and (21) guarantee that every seway is magcal the chosen element is magcal.\n\nthus the entire proof rests only on linking \u201csiderator \u2286 newval\u201d (premises 3, 18, 26), \u201cseway \u2286 magcal\u201d (premises 14, 21), \u201can existing seway that is tocen\u201d (27), and then showing \u201ctocen \u21d2 eastered\u201d (via 5, 8, 22, 7, 12, 4, 19, 16, 6, 13) versus \u201cnewval \u21d2 non\u2010eastered\u201d (via 23, 20, 11, 25). every one of these 20 premises is necessary in this chain of reasoning\u2014and no fewer premises will suffice.",
